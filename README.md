# Internal Icon Browser

Internal Icon Browser is a simple Editor Window that allows you to browse internal icons that are currently loaded.

This tool is inspired by [Unity Internal Icons](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/unity-internal-icons-70496) (thanks to [@p-groarke](https://github.com/p-groarke)). It uses the same technique for finding internal icons but with the window layout rebuilt from scratch to improove usability.
